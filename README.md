Collection of yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solution attempts.

This year I'm trying out [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)


## [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

In 2022 I want to learn some [Go](https://go.dev).


## [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

In 2021 I tried [Kotlin](https://github.com/eratio08/advent-of-code-2021-kotlin) motivated by the [Kotlin by JetBrains YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Kotlin).
