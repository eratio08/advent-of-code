# Advent Of Code

Collecting yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solution attempts.

# [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

In 2022 I want to learn some [Go](https://go.dev).

# [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

In 2021 I tried [Kotlin](https://github.com/eratio08/advent-of-code-2021-kotlin) motivated by the [Kotlin by JetBrains YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Kotlin).
